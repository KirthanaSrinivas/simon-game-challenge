The Simon Game is a classic electronic memory game that challenges players to repeat a sequence of lights and sounds in the correct order. Here's how it works:

Game Rules:
The game starts by lighting up one button and playing a corresponding sound.

The player must press the same button.

The game then adds another step to the sequence (e.g., lights up a second button).

The player must repeat the entire sequence in order.

Each round increases the sequence length, making it progressively harder.

If the player makes a mistake, the game ends.

Game Components:
Four colored buttons (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow).

Each button has a unique sound.

A score counter tracking how many steps the player remembers.

Objective:
The goal is to remember and correctly repeat the longest sequence possible.
